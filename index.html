  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <h2>Kalman Filter</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Asteroids was a two-part project for Artificial Intelligence for Robotics. The purpose was to demonstrate the usage
    of a Kalman Filter. The goal of the first part was to track a group of asteroids (moving with a constant
    acceleration) on a 2-D map and predict their next location. The goal of the second part was to use those predictions
    to navigate a spaceship through the asteroid field to a goal location.
  </p>
  <h3>Part 1</h3>
  <p>
    If the first part, the testing suite would give a noisy x and y location of all of the asteroids on the map. Then
    the code would have to process those values and return an estimate of where the asteroids will be at the next time
    step. The test was passed once 90% of the estimates were considered accurate. The margin to be an accurate estimate
    was pre-set by the testing suite.
  </p>

  <p>
    The x and y measurements were used to develop and update a belief of the location of each asteroid. The Kalman
    Filter uses a gaussian to represent the state. The mean of the gaussian represents the estimate of where the
    asteroid is. The variance of the gaussian represents the certainty of that belief. The Kalman Filter is effective in
    solving this problem because it can process each of those measurements and over time see through the noise to learn
    a more accurate estimation of the true position of the asteroid. It can also use the position measurements to infer
    an estimation of the velocity and acceleration of the asteroids.

    The gif shows the location estimates from the Kalman Filter converging as the filter develops. Green dots are
    correct estimates within a tolerance. Red dots are estimates outside of that tolerance. The gif ends when 90% of the
    estimates are
  </p>
  <h3>Part 2</h3>
  <p>
    In the second part, the testing suite would give noisy x and y locations of the asteroid, like in part 1, but
    instead of returning the estimates for the positions of the asteroids, the code would need to return an action for
    the space ship. It always started in the middle at the bottom of the map and needed to get to the top of the map
    without crashing into any asteroids.
  </p>

  <p>
    The kalman filter was used again to track and predict the locations of all of the asteroids. The estimated locations
    were then used to decide the best action for the ship to get it to the goal. The ship could turn left, turn right,
    or continue straight, and it could speed up, slow down, or maintain the same speed. This leaves 9 different action
    combinations and 9 different states that the ship could be in at the next time step.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of these future states were given a score based on 3 metrics. The closer the position was to the top of the map
    (the goal location) the more points the position got. Only asteroids that were already on the map were being
    tracked. This means that it was possible that a new untracked asteroid could appear on the map near the edges, so
    being close to the edges was dangerous for the ship. The second metric protected against this by giving points if
    the position was not near the edge. The third metric looked at all the asteroids within an area around the ship. The
    ship lost points for each asteroid in the area. The number of points lost was proportional to the distance of each
    asteroid squared. This really punished positions that were close to asteroids and incentivised keeping a good
    distance from any asteroids. Coefficients for the three metrics were then adjusted to ensure that the ship kept
    moving forward while still staying centered and avoiding asteroids.
